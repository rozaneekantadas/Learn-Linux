# üêß Linux Filesystem Hierarchy ‚Äì Detailed Documentation

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the Linux filesystem structure. It describes the purpose and usage of each top-level directory within the root (`/`) filesystem.

---

## üî∞ Root Directory `/`

The root directory is the **starting point of the Linux filesystem hierarchy**. Everything in Linux, including files, directories, and mounted storage devices, stems from this root directory (`/`).

## üìÅ Directory Structure and Purpose

### `/root` ‚Äì Root User‚Äôs Home
- Home directory for the `root` (superuser) account.
- Used by administrators for scripts, logs, and personal root-level storage.

### `/bin` ‚Äì Essential User Binaries
- Contains essential command-line tools required for basic system operation.
- Examples: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `cat`

### `/sbin` ‚Äì System Binaries
- System administration commands, mostly intended for the root user.
- Examples: `mount`, `fsck`, `shutdown`, `reboot`

### `/lib` ‚Äì Shared Libraries
- Libraries essential for binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
- Similar to `.dll` files in Windows.

### `/usr` ‚Äì User System Resources
- Contains user utilities, applications, and read-only program data.
- Includes `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/share`

### `/boot` ‚Äì Boot Loader and Kernel Files
- Contains kernel image and GRUB files needed during system startup.
- Key files: `vmlinuz`, `initrd`, `grub.cfg`

### `/dev` ‚Äì Device Files
- Special files representing hardware devices (disks, USBs, terminals).
- Examples: `/dev/sda`, `/dev/tty`

### `/etc` ‚Äì Configuration Files
- Central directory for system-wide configuration.
- Important files: `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/fstab`, `/etc/hostname`

### `/home` ‚Äì User Home Directories
- Stores personal directories for regular (non-root) users.
- Example: `/home/john`, `/home/sara`

### `/media` ‚Äì Removable Media Mounts
- Used for auto-mounted removable devices like USBs and DVDs.

### `/mnt` ‚Äì Temporary Mount Points
- Reserved for manually mounted filesystems (e.g., for recovery or backup).

### `/proc` ‚Äì Process & Kernel Info (Virtual FS)
- Virtual filesystem providing real-time system and kernel data.
- Examples: `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/[pid]`

### `/sys` ‚Äì Kernel Device Info (Pseudo FS)
- Exposes kernel device and driver information.
- Works with `/proc` for hardware-level introspection.

### `/run` ‚Äì Runtime Data
- Stores volatile runtime data like PID files and Unix sockets.
- Contents are lost after a reboot.

### `/srv` ‚Äì Service Data
- Data served by services such as FTP and web servers.
- Examples: `/srv/www`, `/srv/ftp`

### `/var` ‚Äì Variable Data
- Stores log files, mail spools, and application caches.
- Subdirectories: `/var/log`, `/var/lib`, `/var/spool`

### `/tmp` ‚Äì Temporary Files
- Temporary files created by applications and scripts.
- Cleared on system reboot.

### `/opt` ‚Äì Optional Software
- For installing third-party or proprietary software.
- Example: `/opt/google/chrome`
